# Learning and Memory â€“ From Brain to Behavior ðŸ§ 

This repository contains all the materials and contributions from the **Learning and Memory** course during the Monsoon 2024 semester at IIIT Hyderabad. The course explored how humans and animals learn, form, and retain memories through a blend of neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science.

## **Folder Structure**

### **1. End-Sem Presentation**
This folder contains the final group presentation titled:  
*Investigating Episodic Memory Consolidation Through REM- and NREM-Dominant Sleep Cycles Using Virtual Reality*.  

- **Objective:** Examine how immersive VR tasks and distinct sleep stages (REM and NREM) influence episodic memory consolidation.  
- **Key Elements:**  
  - Participants performed VR-based episodic tasks before sleep.  
  - Memory recall and neuroimaging data were analyzed post-sleep to identify sleep-dependent consolidation patterns.  
- **Findings:**  
  - NREM sleep enhanced detailed memory retention.  
  - REM sleep improved emotional narrative recall.  
- **Broader Implications:** Potential applications in personalized learning and interventions for memory disorders.
